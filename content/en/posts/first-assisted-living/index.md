A late addition to the days news of four new cases has added an additional two for today, March 11th, 2020.

Not only was todays release of new cases delayed for many hours beyond the normal time of release, but this slow drip of information seems deliberate in an attempt to control the news cycle of Oregon cases. This is especially concerning because this latest news is a scary escalation of the positive cases reported in Oregon. If the virus begins to spread in communities of the highly vulnerable it can quickly turn into a major disaster.
